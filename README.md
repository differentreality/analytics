# Analytics with Graph API

This repo contains the Ruby on Rails web application which was developed as part of my Masters thesis project, Analytics for social networks through Facebook Graph API

To use the application, users need to login with their Facebook account and have Facebook pages for which they have proper permissions.

The application is [available online](https://analytics.stellarouzi.com)
